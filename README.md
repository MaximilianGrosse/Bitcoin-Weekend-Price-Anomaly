# Bitcoin Weekend Signal Trading Strategy

In this capstone assignment for the Hedge Funds course, we develop a systematic trading strategy that leverages Bitcoin's weekend price movements as predictive signals for early-week market action.

## The Idea

The core hypothesis explored is that Bitcoin's price action over the weekend, when traditional markets are closed, may offer insights into early-week movements for correlated assets due to unique liquidity dynamics. 
This was tested across a broad universe, including traditional equities, bonds, currencies, and Bitcoin-related equities and ETFs.

## Methodology

* **Systematic Approach:** Rule-based signal generation and position sizing.
* **Diverse Asset Coverage:** Tested across 13 distinct instruments.
* **Dynamic Sizing Methodologies:** Explored binary, Z-score, volatility-based, and volatility-of-volatility adjustments.
* **Rigorous Backtesting:** Extensive in-sample (2021-2023) and out-of-sample (2024-2025) periods.

## Results

* Bitcoin-related assets consistently showed **superior risk-adjusted returns** (Info-Sharpe ratio up to 1.49) compared to traditional macro assets.
* The analysis revealed robust market inefficiencies, particularly strong within the crypto-exposed space.

## The Tech we used

This entire systematic trading and backtesting framework was developed leveraging advanced Excel functionalities. 
This included complex formulas, intricate conditional logic, and robust spreadsheet design to handle data analysis, signal generation, and comprehensive performance evaluation.
Due to the quantitative nature of the Excel file, I made space for this project here.
